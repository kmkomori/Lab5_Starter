(1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

    I would not unit test for the "message" feature, as that topic is too broad in terms of a messaging application. We should test more specific aspects of messaging on the app.

(2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

    I would use unit testing for the "max message length" feature as there is a clear fail/pass criteria. It is also isolated enough to not have to alter too much code.
